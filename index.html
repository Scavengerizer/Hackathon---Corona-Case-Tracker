    <button class="accordion">What can I do to protect myself?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>Exactly how people become infected with this virus is not known at this time. However, some general measures that would be prudent and help prevent the acquisition of any respiratory illness are to avoid close contact, when possible, with anyone who shows symptoms of illness (coughing and sneezing), and to maintain good hand hygiene.</p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Can humans become infected with novel coronavirus from animals? If so, which ones should we be concerned about?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>WHO is closely monitoring the situation to identify how people are being exposed. There is currently no direct evidence that the human cases were exposed through direct contact with animals. </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="accordion">Is there a treatment for the novel coronavirus?</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>There is no specific treatment for disease caused by novel coronavirus. However, many of the symptoms caused by this virus can be treated and therefore treatment should be based on the symptoms of the patient. Moreover, supportive care for infected persons can be highly effective.</p>
    </div> 

    <button class="accordion">Should I worry about COVID-19? </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p></p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones. </div> 

    <button class="accordion">Who is at risk of developing severe illness? </button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people, older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes)  appear to develop serious illness more often than others. </p></div> 

        <button class="accordion">Is there a vaccine, drug or treatment for COVID-19? </button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. </p></div> 

     <button class="accordion">How long is the incubation period for COVID-19? </button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available.</p></div>
