# Hackathon---Corona-Case-Tracker
Made an updated interactive frontend connected with an API using xhr which displays information on corona cases worldwide. 
This is part of a website I made for a hackathon. It also includes a homepage and a ration calculator, the idea behind it being to stop the panic of bulk buying among citizens. It uses an average consumption estimation for the most essential commodities in India households.
